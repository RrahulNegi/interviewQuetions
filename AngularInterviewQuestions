Angular interview questions

1) What is Angular?

- Its a binding framework which binds the html UI and Javascript model
 
- its a mvc/mvvm arch
 
- it help in build single page Application using concept of routing.
-it has DI,HTTP

2) Angular js vs Angular ?
 Angular js :
 - language Javascript
 - Mobile compliant : No
 Lazy Lodaing : No
 Server Side : no
 Cli : No
 
 Angular :
 Language : TypeScript
 Mobile Complaint : yes 
 Lazy Loading : Yes
 Server Side : yes 
 cli : yes
 
 3) Directives in Angular ?
  
 - it help u to attach behaviour in html or its a angular syntax in angular like :
 [(ngModel)], [hidden]
 
 if i put ngmodel in input text box so now it start binding the data 
 this is angular syntax in html which change the behaviour of dom
 
 4) Kind of directives ?
 
 -Structural : it change the structure of dom element like add or remove it example <tr *ngFor =" let temp of list">
 </tr>
 
 -Attribute : it changes the behaviour or look n feel of html 
 <dv [hidden]="hide()">Hello</div> 
 it dosnt change the structre of dom
 
 -Component : its a user control which has its own template 
  
  
 5) what is npm ?
 
 - it is node package manager which makes installation of javasctipt framework easy like jqquey,  angular etc
 
 npm isnatll jquery
 
 - node_modules is the folder where all packages are installed
  
 6)what is package.json?
 
 its a file where we have ajavascript refrences are listed in it
 
 7)what is typescript ?
 
 its adds type to javascript
 its a super set of javascript 
 its get compiled to javascript
 its gives oop concept env like we can use extends, interfaces
 
 8) Importance of Angular CLI?
  
  Command line interfaces
  it help in create redimate project
  - npm install @angular/cli ===> install angular cli
  
  - ng new myapp ==> create a project template with base source code
  
 9) what is component and module?
 
 - aS WE KNW ANGULAR IS BINDING FRAME WORK it binds view and model easliy 
 - so componet is middle ware which combine view and model
 - module groups the compoment
 
 10)What is decorator ?
 
 - it define what knid of Angular clas is it. 
 - ex : if we decorate @Component then it is angular, if we put @NgModule it becomes Angulat Module
 
 11) What are Templates ?
 
 its an html view of Angular in which we can write directives
 - we can define it inline  or we can creates seprate file and connect it using templateUrl: 'abc.html '
 
 12) What are diffrence type of databinding ?
 
 - it define how the view and component communicate
 
 a) Expression /interpolation : 
	-data flow from component to template/view  
	- we can mix it in html {{}}
 b) property bidniding :
 
	- data flows from component to the view 
	- represent like : []
	-it get bind with the input types 
	<input [hidden]="hide()">
 c) Event binding :
	send data from view to the componet like () 
	<button (click)="sendMsg()"/>
	
e) two way binding :
	- send data from controller to view and view to controller 
	<input [(ngModel)] ="">
	
13) Explain architecture of Angular ?
 - template : html view
 - component : template/view talks to component
 -Modules : its a gropu of components
 - binding :- its binds view to comonent or component to view
 - directives :- in template we have various directives
 - service :- it create a common logic 
 - DI : this services get injectted inside the components using DI
 
 14) SPA 
 -in this  where main ui gets loaded once and then needed UI is loaded on demand
 
 - like in html we have header footer or left footer it gets loaded only once
 - and if user hits the link only that thing will get loaded from the server
 - performance advantage
 
 15) how do we implements SPA ?
 
 - we use angular routing.
 - So routing i sa simple collection of URL and components
- when Url is called which leads to loading a component
- routing helps to define  the navigation  for your angular application.
- So if we want to move from one screen to another we should respect SPA tha means not loading abd refrehing the whole UI routing is needed
- it define navigation 
{path: 'home', componnet : HomeComponent}

in html we define <router-outlet></router-outlet>

<a [routerLink]="['Home']">Home </a>

we needthree things for this a router, a router outlet and a router link

if we want to do it from component we do like :

this.route.navigate(['/Home']);

16) What is Lazy loding?

it means on demad loading .
- loading only the necessary html, css and javascript so we have better performance

17) How to implements lazy loading ?

- divide project in seprate modules like Home module, customer module

- Use loadChilren to loda module

like in  HomeAppRouting.ts

export const HomeRoutes =[
	{path: 'Customer', loadChilren: '../CustApp/CustApp.Modules'
]

18) What are services ?

- share common funstionality in project 

19) what is DI ?

- its a design pattern where class rather then insentatiing object from the class it rather it get prefer from outside  and send it to class.

- constructor(public ser : ServiceLogger){
}

- we use providers[] belongs to ngModules

20) Benifits of DI?

-Decoupling (i.e when we do change at one place we didnt have to change on another place)

21) ng serve and ng build
 - ng serve : it builds angular application in memory.
 - ng build : build the angular application on hard disk.
	- it crate a "dist" folder 
	- it use in production
	
22) Explain the --prod parameter in ng build do ?
- it makes application redy for production
- it makes most compress build
- it compree the js file.
