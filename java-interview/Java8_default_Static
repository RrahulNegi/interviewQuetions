A) Default Methods
1) Definition With Example
Default methods of an interface are the concrete methods i.e methods with body for which implementing classes need not to give implementation. They inherit default implementation. Default methods start with the modifier default.

interface InterfaceWithDefaultMethod
{
    void abstractMethod();           //Abstract Method
     
    default void defaultMethod()
    {
        System.out.println("It is a default method");
    }
}
 
class AnyClass implements InterfaceWithDefaultMethod
{
    @Override
    public void abstractMethod() 
    {
        System.out.println("Abstract Method implemented");
    }
     
    //No need to implement defaultMethod()
}

2) Why Default Methods?
Default methods are introduced to add extra features to current interfaces without disrupting their existing implementations. For example, stream() is a default method which is added to Collection interface in Java 8. If stream() would have been added as abstract method, then all classes implementing Collection interface must have implemented stream() method which may have irritated existing users.

Thanks to Java 8 default method feature, now it is a default method, all implementations of Collection interface inherit default implementation of stream() method.

3) Three Rules To Solve Diamond Problem
In Java, a class can extend only one class but can implement multiple interfaces. With the introduction of default methods, it is possible that your class inherit multiple methods with same signature. In such scenarios, to solve the conflict, Java 8 specifies 3 rules to follow.

Rule 1 : Select classes over interfaces

If your class inherit multiple methods with same signature then a method from super class is selected (Remember a class can inherit only one class).

For example, in the below program, anyMethod() from ClassOne is called.

interface InterfaceOne
{
    default void anyMethod()
    {
        System.out.println("Hi... From Interface One");
    }
}
 
interface InterfaceTwo extends InterfaceOne
{
    @Override
    default void anyMethod() 
    {
        System.out.println("Hi... From Interface Two");
    }
}
 
class ClassOne implements InterfaceOne, InterfaceTwo
{
    @Override
    public void anyMethod() 
    {
        System.out.println("Hi... From Class One");
    }
}
 
public class MyClass extends ClassOne implements InterfaceOne, InterfaceTwo
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        new MyClass().anyMethod();
    }
}
Output :

1
Hi... From Class One
Rule 2 : Select most specific interfaces than general interfaces.

If your class doesn’t extend any class and inherit multiple methods with same signature from multiple interfaces which belong to same hierarchy, then a method from most specific interface is selected (If interface X extends Y then X is more specific than Y).

For example, In the below program, anyMethod() from InterfaceTwo is called.


interface InterfaceOne
{
    default void anyMethod()
    {
        System.out.println("Hi... From Interface One");
    }
}
 
interface InterfaceTwo extends InterfaceOne
{
    @Override
    default void anyMethod() 
    {
        System.out.println("Hi... From Interface Two");
    }
}
 
public class MyClass implements InterfaceOne, InterfaceTwo
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        new MyClass().anyMethod();
    }
}
Output :

1
Hi... From Interface Two
Rule 3 : InterfaceName.super.methodName()

If your class doesn’t extend any class and inherit multiple methods with same signature from multiple interfaces which doesn’t belong to same hierarchy, then override that method and from within body explicitly call desired method as InterfaceName.super.methodName().

For example, in the below program, anyMethod() from InterfaceOne is called explicitly.


interface InterfaceOne
{
    default void anyMethod()
    {
        System.out.println("Hi... From Interface One");
    }
}
 
interface InterfaceTwo 
{
    default void anyMethod() 
    {
        System.out.println("Hi... From Interface Two");
    }
}
 
public class MyClass implements InterfaceOne, InterfaceTwo
{
    @Override
    public void anyMethod()
    {
        InterfaceOne.super.anyMethod();
    }
     
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        new MyClass().anyMethod();
    }
}
Output :

1
Hi... From Interface One



B) Static Methods

1) Definition With Example
From Java 8, interfaces can also have static methods. Static methods are also concrete methods but they can’t be implemented.


interface InterfaceWithDefaultAndStaticMethod
{
    void abstractMethod();           //Abstract Method
     
    default void defaultMethod()
    {
        System.out.println("It is a default method");
    }
     
    static void staticMethod()
    {
        System.out.println("It is a static method");
    }
}
 
class AnyClass implements InterfaceWithDefaultAndStaticMethod
{
    @Override
    public void abstractMethod() 
    {
        System.out.println("Abstract Method implemented");
    }
     
    //No need to implement defaultMethod()
     
    //Can't implement staticMethod()
}

2) Why Static Methods?
Do you know? Collection and Collections.

Collection is an interface and Collections is an utility class containing only static methods which operate on Collection objects.

Java API developers have followed this pattern of supplying an utility class along with an interface to perform basic operations on such objects. But from Java 8, they have break this pattern by introducing static methods to interfaces.

With the introduction of static methods to interface, such utility classes will disappear and methods to perform basic operations will be kept as static methods in interface itself.




===================================================================================

Differences Between Interface And Abstract Class After Java 8 :
1) Fields
Interface fields are public, static and final by default. Interfaces still don’t support non-static and non-final variables. Interfaces can only have public, static and final variables. On the other hand, abstract class can have static as well as non-static and final as well as non-final variables. They also support private and protected variables along with public variables.

2) Methods
After Java 8, an interface can have default and static methods along with abstract methods. Interfaces don’t support final methods. But, abstract classes support final as well as non-final methods and static as well as non-static methods along with abstract methods.

Also note that, only interfaces can have default methods. Abstract classes can’t have default methods.

3) Constructors
Interfaces can’t have constructors. Abstract classes can have any number of constructors.

4) Member’s Accessibility
All members of interfaces are public by default. Interfaces don’t support private and protected members. But, abstract classes support all type of members – private, protected and public members.

5) Multiple Inheritance
A class can extend only one abstract class, but can implement multiple interfaces. Thus, a class can inherit multiple properties from multiple sources only through interfaces, not through abstract classes.
