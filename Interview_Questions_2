Interview Question

1) Reverse the string using string in build function
char chars[] str.toCharArray();
for(int i = chars.length-1; i>-0; i--){
sop(chars[i])
} 

2) Palindrom 
3) Second highest no from array 
int largest =0
int secondlargest = 0
for(int i =0; i< arr.length; i++){
	if(arr[i]> largest){
		secondlargest = largest
		largest = arr[i]
	}
	else if(arr[i] > secondlargest){
		secondlargest = arr[i]
		}
}

4) error vs exception

error : caused by the env in which apllication is running
exception : occur due to application 
 
5) try with resources

try(FileReader fr =  new FileReader(""); BufferReader br = new BufferReader("")){

------
} catch(IOException e) {
e.printStackTrace()
}
}

- its out closable

6) MultiCatch block

tr {

} catch(FileNotFoundException | EOFException e){

} 

7) Angular life cycle :

- ngOnChanges - ngOnInit - ngDoCheck - ngAfterContentInt - ngAfterContentChecked - ngAfterViewInit - ngAgterViewChecked - ngOnDestroy

8)WeakHashmap '
its a normal hashmap but use weak refrence for kesys which means if the key object dosnt have any refrences then both key/value will become eligible for garbage colllection

9) Object oriented vs object based
 OO : support oops concept
 OB : dont support all feature of oops like polymorphism and inheritance
 
10) Syncronized object : vector , hashtable
11) Other then String what r diffrent immutale classes
All primitive wrapper classe like Boolean, Character, Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float and Double

29) latching wrt multi threading
30) Diffrent tupe of  cloud platforms

--------------------
31) design pattern use in jdk
32) concurrent api in java
33)expose a rst api which will take two inputs(range of numbers) we need to treverse between two numbers and dend back the response in the json format and if any number divisible by 3 we need to replace thatr no by FIZZ and if it is divisible by 5 we need to replace it with BUZZ at same time we were asked to create a project in GIT and check in the code every 15 min and write juint test case
Input 1 and 10
o/p : 1,2, FIZZ,4, Buzz, Fizz,...

34) why return type is not consider in overloading in java
- the overloads in java are only allowd for method with diffrent signatures
-the return type is not part of signatures 
35) can u use hashmap in multithreaded env? What can be the problem?When does get() method go to the infinite loop?

- nothing is wrong it depends upon how you are using example if u initializew a hashmap in just one thread and thenm all threads are only reading from it, then it is perfectly fine.
- The real problem starts when at least one of the thread is updating HashMap i.e adding, changing  or remoing any key-value pair.

- Since put() operation can cause re-sizing and which can furthor lead to an infinite loop thats why either u should use hashTable or concurrentHashMap

36) Marker interface
- Marker interface is used as a tag to inform a message to the Java compiler so that it can add special behaviour to the class implementing it.

37) Design a stack push(), pop() and min()

38) Find one triplet such that indexes are in increasing order so as values at index
 
 39) calculate power x : Power(x,n)
 
 40) Find pivot in sorted rotated array

 44) Read a paragraph from a file and print the palindroms
 45) 5 thhread that perfoem the same task. Main thread starts all these threads. Find out which thread gives fastest result
 46) Dessign a system where you can subscribe to daily needs things
 47)write a program to find the number in sorted array. Constraints : you dont know the size of the array and you should try without finding the array size
